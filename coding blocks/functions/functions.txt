Functions
    A function is a block of statement which runs sequentially to perform a task.
    The data can be passed from outside using function parameters. 


Reference variables
    It is another name for already existing variable.
    When a variable is declared as a reference, it becomes an alternative name for an existing variable.
    A variable can be declared as a reference by putting ‘&’ in the declaration. 

Function declaration vs Function definition

Function Overloading
    In C++, there must be only one function with same signature(name, no of parameters, types of parameters).
    Function overloading is a feature of object oriented programming where two or more functions can have the same name but 
        different parameters or same parameters with different types.
