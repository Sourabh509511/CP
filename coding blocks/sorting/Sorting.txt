Sorting
    It is a way to rearrange the elements either in increasing orserr or decreasing order.


1. Bubble sort
    Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares 
    adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
        Worst complexity: n^2
        Average complexity: n^2
        Best complexity: n
        Space complexity: 1
        Method: Exchanging
        Stable: Yes
        Class: Comparison sort

2. Selection Sort
    Selection sort is a sorting algorithn, works by selecting the smallest element from the array and place it into its right position.
        Worst complexity: n^2
        Average complexity: n^2
        Best complexity: n^2
        Space complexity: 1
        Method: Selection
        Stable: No
        Class: Comparison sort 

3. Insertion Sort
    In insertion sort, replace an element from the unsorted part to sorted part of array.
    In the i'th iteration we've placed 
        Worst complexity: n^2
        Average complexity: n^2
        Best complexity: n
        Space complexity: 1
        Method: Insertion
        Stable: Yes
        Class: Comparison sort
